        <h2 class='subheading'>A paragraph about me</h2>
        <p class='me'> My name is Gurjyot "Garry" Singh Mann, I was born and raised in New Delhi, India and I am a student
            at BCIT, enrolled in the CIT program. 
            I studied at St. Cecilia's Public School for all my 12 years of school, I passed my grade 10 with 84% average.
            I like a lot of things and I am easily fascinated by the simplest of facts, and hence I love acquiring more 
            and more knowledge in about any field I can possibly find.
            I love the Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings franchises, I also love watching anime, playing games, 
            solving puzzles, and helping others. 
            I am an introverted person so it takes me a while to make friends. 
            I am a big fan of the football (soccer) team FC Barcelona.
            A cool fact about me is that I am ambidextrous, I am good at using both my hands for doing stuff.
